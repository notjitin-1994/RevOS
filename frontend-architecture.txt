Frontend Architecture: The Precision Volt System
Version: 1.0 Project Identity: Dark Mode Native Automotive SaaS


Core Philosophy: "The Grease-Proof Interface" — High contrast, high legibility, and touch-optimized for garage environments. 



1. Core Technology Stack
This architecture leverages the specific "Precision Volt" constraints to build a performant, type-safe application.

Framework: Next.js 14+ (App Router). Chosen for its robust routing and server-side rendering capabilities, essential for SEO and initial load speed in low-bandwidth garage environments. 

Styling Engine: Tailwind CSS. Configured strictly for the "Digital Volt" palette (#CCFF00 Lime / #0F172A Graphite). 




Language: TypeScript. Strict typing required for VINs, Part Numbers, and Financial calculations.

Iconography: Lucide React. Configured with 2px stroke and rounded joints to match the "Schematic Stroke" design identity. 

State Management:

Server State: TanStack Query (React Query). Essential for real-time inventory syncing and job card updates.

Client State: Zustand. For managing complex, ephemeral UI states like the multi-step "Job Card" workflow.

Form Handling: React Hook Form + Zod. Critical for validating complex inputs like Engine Numbers and VINs with strict schemas.

2. Layout & Navigation Strategy
The application uses a Responsive Dual-Layout System to handle the transition between the front desk (Desktop) and the repair bay (Mobile).

2.1 The "Bay View" (Desktop/Tablet)

Structure: Sidebar-first approach. 


Sidebar (Fixed w-64): Contains core navigation icons (<Wrench />, <LayoutGrid />) for high-level module access. 


Sticky Header (h-16, z-50): Contains Global Search (VIN lookup) and User Profile. 

Grid System: 12-Column Grid. Dashboard widgets span 3, 4, or 6 columns. Data tables (Inventory) use single-column full width. 

2.2 The "Grease-Proof" View (Mobile)

Philosophy: Thumb-driven navigation with large touch targets (>44px) for mechanics wearing gloves. 


Navigation: Sticky Bottom Navigation Bar (h-16) instead of a top sidebar. 


Action Placement: Primary actions (e.g., "Start Job", "Save") are placed in a fixed bottom bar or floating action button, never at the top left. 


Input Handling: All inputs default to text-base (16px) to prevent iOS auto-zoom. 


3. Design System Implementation (The Volt Standard)
3.1 Color & Theme Enforcement
Dark Mode Default: The app is strictly dark mode (bg-graphite-900). There is no light mode toggle. 


Primary Action: #CCFF00 (Brand Lime). Rule: Text on Lime must always be #0F172A (Graphite-900). 


Status Colors:

Success: Teal (#2DD4BF). CRITICAL: Never use Green, to avoid conflict with Brand Lime. 


Error: Red (#EF4444) for critical failures. 


Depth: Depth is achieved via Overlay (bg-graphite-700) + Glow Shadows (shadow-glow), not black shadows. 

3.2 Typography Strategy
Three distinct font families are used to distinguish data types instantly:

Headings: font-display (Barlow). Used for H1-H3 structure and branding. 

UI Text: font-sans (Inter). Highly legible interface text. 

Data: font-mono (JetBrains Mono). CRITICAL: Must be used for VINs, License Plates, IP Addresses, and Prices to distinguish 0 vs O. 


4. Module-Specific Architectures
4.1 Job Card Management (The Core Workflow)
View: Kanban Board (Desktop) / Vertical Stack (Mobile).

Data Pattern: The "VIN Pattern" is applied to every vehicle reference:

Label: text-xs font-medium uppercase tracking-wider text-graphite-400. 

Value: font-mono text-sm text-white tracking-wide. 

Features:

Synced Details: Uses React Query invalidation to pull fresh Customer/Vehicle data when a Job Card opens.


Live Status: Status badges use the 10% opacity background style (bg-status-success/10). 

4.2 Inventory & Parts

View: High-density Data Tables. 


Low-Stock Warning: Visualized using the text-status-warning (#F59E0B) color token. 


Interactions: Mobile users use Swipe-to-Reveal actions (Swipe Left to Delete, Swipe Right to Mark Used). 

4.3 Employee & Schedule
RBAC (Role-Based Access):

Owner/Admin: Full access to Financials/Margins.

Mechanic: View-only for Schedule, Edit access for Job Cards.

Visuals: Time slots use border-graphite-700 dividers. Current time is marked by a border-brand (Lime) line.

5. Component Library Standards
All components must be built mobile-first using the following patterns:

5.1 Buttons

Primary: bg-brand text-graphite-900 shadow-glow. 


Secondary: border border-graphite-600 text-white. 


Touch Targets: Parent containers must have p-2 to ensure minimum 44x44px target size. 

5.2 Micro-interactions
Motion: "Industrial Smoothness" — Hydraulic easing (fast start, smooth stop). No bouncy springs. 


Feedback: "Volt Pulse" — Buttons emit a ring pulse of brand color upon completion. 


Mobile Feedback: Since there is no hover on mobile, use active:scale-[0.98] for tactile feedback.
